# Acenic Spammer

This project sets up and runs multiple Discord bots concurrently using the `discord.py` library. It includes features like sending direct messages and providing invite links.

## Features

- **Multiple Bots**: Supports running multiple bots concurrently.
- **Direct Messaging**: Allows sending direct messages to users.
- **Invite Command**: Generates an invite link for the bot.

## Prerequisites

- `discord.py` library

## Installation

1. Download the repository:

2. Run the `install.bat` file to install the required dependencies.

    ```bash
    install.bat
    ```

3. Create a `tokens.txt` file in the root directory of the project and add your bot tokens, one per line. You can use account tokens too, but they are easily bannable, so it's preferred to use bot tokens.

    your_bot_token_3
    ```
